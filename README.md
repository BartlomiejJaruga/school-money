# SchoolMoney

SchoolMoney is a platform for managing class funds. Parents can register, manage their children, create classes, organize collections, track payments, upload receipts, and generate financial reports. Treasurers can invite parents, handle virtual transfers, and oversee class-wide fundraising.
